Yubikey PHP Class

Version 0.96

Included are two files:

Yubikey.php - The Yubikey class

yubikeytest.php - A sample php script which uses the class.


Pretty self explanitory. Open 'yubikeytest.php' and change the
$apiID and $signatureKey variables to the id and key you got from
Yubico. If you have no idea what I'm talking about, go to:

https://api.yubico.com/get-api-key/

Enter your email and your Yubikey output and Yubico will supply you
with an id and key.

The 'Yubikey.php' file has instructions at its head.
